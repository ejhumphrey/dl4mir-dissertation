\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

There once was a time I thought it was some happy accident that I kept finding myself in exactly the right place.
Be it college, career, or concert, it always felt like gravity, quietly inevitable, pulling me into the things I should do, the places I should go, the opportunities I should pursue.
But now, on the backside of this arc, I can see quite plainly that I always had the direction wrong; it was never a pull, but a push.
Come to think of it, for as long as I can seem to recall, I have been lucky enough to be surrounded by those who would inspire, encourage, force, drag, and challenge me to always be better.
I am nothing short of blessed to be graced by the company and influence of such wonderful human beings, and will try my best to thank as many of you as I can here.

First and foremost, I am forever grateful to my grandparents ---Glendolyn \& Norman, Elizabeth \& Frank--- for their myriad contributions, both concrete and intangible.
It is only for their love, diligence and sacrifice that any of this is possible (but what I wouldn't give to see your reactions now).
This goes doubly so for my parents, Sharon \& Branden, who took a computer-tinkering, dinosaur-building, saxophone-wielding dreamer and turned him into a computer-sciencing, wood-working, guitar-wielding dreamer.
Good job, guys.
An extra special thanks goes to my brothers, Steve \& Tim, for all adventures, past, present, and future.

% Formative years
To those who had a most profound impact on my younger self:
Paul Andersen, who helped introduce me to music, and more importantly, improvisation;
Mary Bolton, who truly was ``Mary E. Best'', and is near entirely to thank (or blame) for my egregious use of analogy;
Matt McGuire, who instilled the virtues of hard work, effort, and discipline, and earned my deepest respect for it;
and Jayant Datta, who saw something in a kid with long hair and an unhealthy love of delay pedals, and happily pushed him down the rabbit hole of higher education.
