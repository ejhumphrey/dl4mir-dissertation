This template provides the basic skeleton necessary to complete your dissertation.
It has been populated with cupcake ipsum in the hopes that this sweet gibberish will make the task less daunting.
Compiling this document is mostly straightforward in TexShop, but the glossary must be compiled manually; your mileage may vary in other environments.
Additionally, it is strongly recommended that you use a version control system, e.g. git, while writing your dissertation. 
If you do so, you may find it significantly easier to keep each sentence on its own line, which plays to the atomicity of ongoing modifications.
